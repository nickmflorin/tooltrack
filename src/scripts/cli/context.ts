    /* When execuding the seed command locally, against the production database, it is important
       that the environment values pulled from Vercel are in fact for the production environment,
       not the default development environment.  Otherwise, we can accidentally store the personal
       Clerk user as the development Clerk user, not the production one.

       When the script(s) 'seeddb-prod' or 'migrate-reset-prod' are run, this script will get
       executed using production environment variables that are found locally in the repository,
       in the '.env' file.

       In this case, the database connection parameters are pulled from '.env', which contains the
       environment variables pulled via Vercel's CLI, via either the 'pullenv' script (for
       the development environment variables) or 'pullenv-prod' (for the production environment
       variables).  In both cases, however, the '.env' file contains connection parameters for the
       production database, NOT the development database...

       If in development mode, the development database connection parameters are overridden in
       '.env.development', to avoid connecting to the production database locally.  But when this
       script is run in a production context, that does not apply.

       However, the '.env' file may contain development values for the Clerk tokens, if the
       '.env' file wasn't populated via Vercel's CLI with the production flag (e.g. the last time
        the environment was pulled it was done with 'pullenv' instead of 'pullenv-prod').

       This means that the Clerk tokens in the '.env' file may be development tokens, while the
       database parameters are for the production database.  This means that we could incidentally
       wind up connecting to the production database, while at the same time using development Clerk
       tokens (which affect the 'clerkId' stored on the 'User' model).

       If seeding the production database, it is important that the command

       $ pnpm pullenv-prod

       be run, not the 'pnpm pullenv' command.

       To prevent errors from happening due to this mismatch, we have to perform this check. */
